# movie-recommendation-system

This project involves creating a recommendation system for movies.\
The system utilizes the concept of embeddings to detect and recommend movies simlar to the movies liked by the user. The system learns user embeddings and movie embeddings by using matrix factorization. Movies recommended would then be either movies similar to movies the user likes or movies liked by another user that is similar to the user. A user being similar to another user is translated by being close to each other in the user embeddings.
